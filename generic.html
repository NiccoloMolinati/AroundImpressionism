							<h1 class="major">SELECTED ITEMS</h1>
							
							<p>The ten items we have chosen represent different aspects of Impressionism.
								Starting with sketches that never became full paintings and finishing with an educational podcast.
								Those items form an intricate relationship network and create a beautiful picture on their own without being outshined by the well known masterpieces.
								In choosing them we strived to present a less known side of the impressionism and to show that it can be not only about paintings.</p>
